📥 Data Source
---------------

The data used in this project was acquired from the "Toy Sales" dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/toy-sales). The dataset contains information about products, stores, sales transactions, and inventory levels for the Maven Toy Store chain from January 2017 to September 2018, provided in CSV format.

🔄 Data Preparation
-------------------

The CSV files were cleaned and modeled using Power Query in Power BI Desktop. This process involved data cleaning, transformation, and merging the different tables to create a consolidated data model for analysis and visualization.

📈 Dashboards
-------------

The project includes two main dashboards:

### 💸 Sales Dashboard

This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the store's sales performance, including:

- 📈 Total Orders by Product Category
- 📅 Total Revenue by Start of Month, Year, Quarter, Month, and Day
- 📦 Units Sold - Detailed Table by Month and Product
- 📈 Units Sold by Product Price
- 📊 Various visualizations related to sales and units sold

### 🗃️ Stock Dashboard

This dashboard provides insights into the store's inventory levels, featuring:

- 🏷️ Total Stock on Hand
- 📍 Stock on Hand by Store Location
- 🗃️ Detailed Table of Stock on Hand by Product
- 📈 Visualizations related to stock levels and units sold by product category

Additionally, the dashboards include various visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and detailed tables, to present the data in an easy-to-understand format.

🔍 Results and Discussion
-------------------------

Based on the visualizations and data provided, here are the key findings and insights:

1. **Top Product Categories**: The Toys and Electronics categories were the top revenue and profit generators, with products like Lego Bricks, Action Figures, and Colorbuds (wireless earbuds/headphones) being the most profitable.

2. **Sales and Profit Trends**: Seasonal trends were observed, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday season and dipping in summer. While Electronics was the second most profitable category, its sales have declined consistently, indicating a potential shift in customer demand. The Arts and Crafts category showed substantial growth in sales.

3. **Store Performance**: The Downtown and Commercial store locations generated the highest revenue and profit, while the Airport and Residential stores contributed relatively lower.

4. **Inventory Management**: Current inventory levels across all stores suggest a potential shortage to meet the monthly demand for units sold, although the adequacy of stock varies by store location.

5. **Product Sales and Inventory**: The data provides detailed insights into units sold by product, product pricing, and stock on hand, which can be leveraged for inventory optimization, product assortment planning, and pricing strategies.
